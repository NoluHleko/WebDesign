                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Nolusindiso Hleko is a multi-talented aspiring software engineer. Born in a tiny town called Jamestown in South Africa, Nolusindiso is currently a full-time student in Germany. She is now based in Busan, South Korea, which she has called home for the past five years. Although an engineering student first, she enjoys exploring her creative side through design. And with life spanned across three different countries on three continents, there is no doubt that she treats each day as an adventure.

                    <h2>Blog Home Page</h2>
                    <p>Full disclosure: I designed this website to fulfill the Software Engineering Basics (SE_01) and Web Development Basics (SE_19) requirements. These two modules were a primary motivation to take ID_19. Thus, the submission of this website as part of my portfolio can be deemed a triple submission, granted I was part of the foundation's course; therefore, SE_01 and SE_19 had one submission. <a href=workflow>Here</a> is the workflow of how this website came to be.</p>

                    <h2>Website Travel Gallery</h2>
                    <p>This page is my take on the masonry design. Inspired by Pinterest (obviously), I wanted to have a page to display travel pictures. This was not only my way of practicing this design but also my way of expressing my love for travel and photography.  <a href="http://nolusindiso.herokuapp.com/travel">Here</a> is a live version of the page from the blog, and <a href="gallery-workflow">here</a> is the workflow.</p>

                    <h2>Insta-Inspired Grid-Gallery<h2>
                    <p>This was my very first attempt at making a gallery with grids. I wanted to create an Instagram-like page. I do not have any sketches because I knew what I wanted to create and had no intentions of sharing this page with anyone. It was just for me to learn, but I kept it and figured it wouldn't hurt to put it here... <a href="/std-grid">read more</a></p>
